System:
  1. A distributed system which will accept multiple incoming requests from the File System and Peers
  2. Has a hashed structure to store the file object values to its addresses
  4. Every Peer will have one backup server.

Server:
  1. Designed to Accept JOIN and BACKUP connections from machines willing to be peers.
  2. Store, Search and Read a file requests from the client.
  3. Stores the mapped structure of File Object Values to Client addresses.
  4. Disconnects the connection between the peer after establishing its location within the decentralized network
  5. Knows the backup server for each peer in the network

  Peer:
    1. Peer is designed to have a finger table or hash table which stores the address of the clients associated with the file chunks(if they are split)
    2. Knows its hashed object Values
    3. Knows its backup server
    4. Runs a synchronous light weight process to maintain updated information.
    5. Backup peer has its current Information stored in a savepoint until updated.
